# Here is a bit about my start at Arcadis
st.write('I have been with Arcadis since July 2015, and I have worked on some very interesting projects.')
st.write('My first project at Arcadis was a renovation and expansion of a waste to energy facility in York, Pennsylvania. There were many great things about this project, but the best was the results.  After all was done, the facility was able to process 200 garbage trucks worth of waste and end up with only 2 trucks worth of material that was not converted to energy or recycled in some way.')

st.write('One of the exciting events was the excavation of the new Tipping Hall pit, which the general contractor - not Arcadis - ended up electing to use blasting for because of the density of rock. If you are interested, you can see a video a couple of seconds long [here](https://arcadiso365.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/teams/project-30001651/mediagallery/Blast%203-6-17%204PM.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=jlSo40&nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJTdHJlYW1XZWJBcHAiLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJTaGFyZURpYWxvZy1MaW5rIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXcifX0%3D).')
st.write('After excavating this massive pit, the general contractor poured a concrete slab roughly equivalent to a football field in one pour, which required some unusal techniques. More photos can be seen [here](https://arcadiso365.sharepoint.com/teams/project-30001651/mediagallery/Forms/Thumbnails.aspx).')

st.write('The other exciting project on this site that I am proud to have been a part of began in concurrence with this one, and was the first Ash Recycling Facility of its kind in the United States.  It takes ash from the waste to energy plant incinerator and harvests all the viable aggregates, metals, and sand, reducing the ash that must be managed at a landfill.')

# Here is a bit about my coding journey
st.write('Now for a bit about my coding journey!')
st.write('I began  when my older brother gave me a Commodore 64 when I was in elementary school. Everything I learned was trial and error and from the little booklet that came in the box. I progressed to BASIC and DOS, then Pascal and a jump to Unix.  I moved away from coding after that and only used what I needed in my other work, such as writing Excel macros and incidental code here and there in a command window.  When our Arcadis Skills Powered Organization program launched, I was part of the pilot program and decided I needed to be intentional about bringing my skills up to date.')
st.write('I searched for an online, FREE, coding course, and I found a Stanford University course "Code in Place", which is equivalent to the first half of their freshman level Introduction to Coding course.  I took that early this spring, and finished it at the end of May, as we were starting this UpSkilling program.  I was really excited when I learned about this Citizen Development program, because it fit perfectly with my goals this year of updating my skills!')

st.write('Here is a link to a very basic Python program that I did as an early project in my "Code in Place" course through Stanford: [my project](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/cip4/share/h25pEezoWb0YAm7svm7y).')
st.write('It is a little arithmetic practice tool.')
